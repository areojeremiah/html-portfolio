<h1>The Best Three Cartoons According to Me</h1>
<h2>My best three cartoons of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Tom and Jerry</h3>
<p>This is my favorite out of the list. It is a comedy cartoon series of a cat (Tom) trying tirelessly to catch a mouse (Jerry). If you are wanting to have a good laugh, I'll recommend this for a start.</p>

<br>

<h3>SpongeBobSquarePants</h3>
<p>This is another cartoon series that evolkes a sense of nostalgia. My second favorite, this is one on a different plane entirely, filles with characters and various uniqueness. A yellow sponge, a starfish, a squirdward, a crab, a squirel, jelly fish and more fun characters all in a sea.</p>

<br>

<h3>Pinocchio</h3>
<p>Unlike the first two, this is not a series but it is also a great cartoon to see. This is about a strange magical talking wood that was spared by a puppet maker, privelegde to live like a real boy, he misused a number of the opportunities he had and he learnt his lessons. And at the end, he got want he always wantes.</p>
